"""Turn the raw patch sources into a git-am-able mailbox series.

Why this exists
---------------
upstream/*.patch are raw ``diff -ruN aa/ bb/`` output. They carry no mail headers,
so ``git am`` rejects them before it ever looks at a hunk -- the upstream README's
``git am /path/to/patches/*.patch`` instruction has never worked. Two of them also
carry macOS ``.DS_Store`` "Binary files ... differ" stanzas, which ``git apply``
refuses ("cannot apply binary patch ... without full index line") even once headers
exist.

On top of that, upstream targeted v6.19-rc8 and we target the tag in kernel-pin.env,
so a few context anchors have drifted. Those are re-anchored from an explicit,
reviewable table (rebase/<tag>.rules) -- never inline in this file.

Two lanes, one pipeline
-----------------------
``upstream/`` holds Ross Cawston's files verbatim. ``ceralive/`` holds first-party
patches this project authored, which have no upstream counterpart. Both lanes go
through the same converter so that ``patches/`` stays fully generated -- the whole
point of the ANTI-PATTERN "don't hand-edit patches/". The lane only changes the
mail header the converter writes and which directory parity is proven against;
every other guarantee is shared.

Guarantees
----------
* Deterministic: same inputs -> byte-identical output. ``--check`` relies on it.
* Behaviour-preserving by construction: a rule may only touch a CONTEXT line.
  Attempting to rewrite a '+'/'-' line raises. scripts/verify-payload-parity.py
  proves the result independently, per lane.
* Upstream numbering (0001/0002/0003/0005, gap at 0004) is never renumbered.
  First-party patches continue the same counter from 0006.

Usage
-----
    scripts/build-series.py            regenerate patches/
    scripts/build-series.py --check    rebuild into a temp dir and diff; non-zero
                                       exit if patches/ is stale or hand-edited
